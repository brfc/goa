                                  Pirmin Duss


The 'api' file defines the include paths required by users of a project that
produces a libraty.


Syntax
######

The file consists of an arbitrary number of lines where each line has the
following structure:

! <selector>

The <selector> is the path to a file or directory within the build directory
to be featured in the api archive.

For directories all files are included.

Examples
########

*include/spdlog.h*

The file 'include/spdlog.h' form the build directory is added as a single
header file.

*include/spdlog/*

All files found in the direcory 'include/spdlog' below the build directory are
added as artifacts. The relative directory structure is kept intact.
